Running Self-Verification
=========================

|st2| package-based installations come with a script, that allows to verify |st2| installation, using |st2| itself.
Currently script covers the following aspects of |st2|:

* Basic ``st2`` commands (similar to the commands outlined in *Manual Verification* section)
* Examples pack installation
* Commands described in Quick Start
* Packs pack actions
* ActionChain and Mistral Workflows

To run the self-verification:

1. Switch to `root` user and save an authentication token into the `ST2_AUTH_TOKEN` variable. Also make sure ST2_API_URL and ST2_AUTH_URL are already defined.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo su
    export ST2_AUTH_TOKEN=`st2 auth <username> -p <password> -t`

2. Run ``st2-self-check`` script:

On Ubuntu / Debian:

.. code-block:: bash

    /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/st2common/bin/st2-self-check

On RedHat / Fedora:

.. code-block:: bash

    /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/st2common/bin/st2-self-check
