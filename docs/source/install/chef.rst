.. note::

   OH NO! You caught us! We don't have documentation for Chef just quite yet! Never fear, we're working on it (promise!!!) If you'd like to help us fill in this section, pull requests are gladly accepted. In the meantime, here are some resources that we do have to get you started.

   * StackStorm Cookbook: https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/stackstorm
   * OpenStack Mistral Cookbook: https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/openstack-mistral

   There, we have documentation on how to consume the cookbooks. Check back here soon for updates. In the meantime, please accept this baby hedgehog. It's just for you.
