Installation
============

.. todo:: Explain installation paths.

For evaluation, get yourself a clean box and fast-forward to All-In-One installer.

For package installation, follow the guide.

If you use configuration management tools, pick you poison. Or, run from source.


.. todo::  Eventually, promote an installer script here, just as it was before:
    ``curl -sSL https://install.stackstorm.com/ | sudo sh``
