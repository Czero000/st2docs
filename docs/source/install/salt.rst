   OH NO! You caught us! We don't have a Salt States or Documentation for Salt just quite yet. Don't fret, we're working on it (promise!!!) If you'd like to help us fill in this section, pull requests are gladly accepted. In the meantime, here are some resources that we do have to get you started.

   * Integrating SaltStack and StackStorm: http://stackstorm.com/2015/07/29/getting-started-with-stackstorm-and-saltstack/

   There, we have a blog post on how to integrate the two systems. Stay tuned to this space for updates very soon! In the meantime, please accept these baby puppies.
